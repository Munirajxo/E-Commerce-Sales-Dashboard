- ## Project Overview
---
This project showcases a custom-built dashboard developed using an extensive E-Commerce sales dataset. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights, helping stakeholders better understand business trends, customer behavior, and sales performance.

I began by constructing a comprehensive data model to structure the information, followed by leveraging Power Query to clean, analyze, and prepare the dataset for deeper analysis. The final step was designing an intuitive and interactive dashboard using Power BI to effectively present key insights, such as sales trends, customer segmentation, and product performance.

This dashboard enables data-driven decision-making for enhanced business strategy and operational efficiency.

In the initial preparation phase, We performed following tasks:
1. Data Structuring: Loaded raw data into Power BI and structured it using data modeling to define relationships between tables.
2. Handling Missing and Duplicate Data: Addressed missing values by imputing or removing incomplete records and eliminated duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
3. Standardizing Formats: Ensured consistent formats for dates, numerical values, and categorical fields across the dataset.
4. Outlier Detection: Identified and managed outliers to prevent skewed analysis results.
5. Calculated Fields: Utilized DAX functions to create calculated columns and measures, enhancing analysis with metrics like total sales and average order value.

### Recommendations
---
- Boost Sales in Low-Performing Regions: Implement targeted marketing and promotions in the South region, which has the lowest sales (16%), to stimulate growth and increase market share.
- Optimize Shipping Strategy: Enhance the efficiency of Standard Class shipping (61%) and encourage the adoption of Same Day shipping through discounts or faster delivery perks to diversify shipping options.
- Seasonal Sales Campaign: Since December has the lowest sales, launch targeted promotions and holiday campaigns during this month to increase revenue and close the sales gap with higher-performing months like October.
- Revitalize Declining Categories: With Technology and Furniture sales declining, introduce new products, bundles, or targeted discounts to stimulate demand and reverse the downward trend.
- Capitalize on Customer Segment Success: Expand personalized offers, loyalty programs, and customer engagement strategies for the Customer segment, which has the highest profit and profit margin, to further drive profitability.

- ## Project Overview
---
This project showcases a custom-built dashboard developed using an extensive E-Commerce sales dataset. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights, helping stakeholders better understand business trends, customer behavior, and sales performance.

I began by constructing a comprehensive data model to structure the information, followed by leveraging Power Query to clean, analyze, and prepare the dataset for deeper analysis. The final step was designing an intuitive and interactive dashboard using Power BI to effectively present key insights, such as sales trends, customer segmentation, and product performance.

This dashboard enables data-driven decision-making for enhanced business strategy and operational efficiency.

- Powerbi -For cleaning the data using power query and dax functions to clean and analyze the data and Built a interactive dashboard 



### Data Cleaning
---
In the initial preparation phase, We performed following tasks:
1. Data Structuring: Loaded raw data into Power BI and structured it using data modeling to define relationships between tables.
2. Handling Missing and Duplicate Data: Addressed missing values by imputing or removing incomplete records and eliminated duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
3. Standardizing Formats: Ensured consistent formats for dates, numerical values, and categorical fields across the dataset.
4. Outlier Detection: Identified and managed outliers to prevent skewed analysis results.
5. Calculated Fields: Utilized DAX functions to create calculated columns and measures, enhancing analysis with metrics like total sales and average order value

- Compensation Increase: The compensation rate increased by $0.68 per hour, amounting to $1,414.40 increase per year for non-smokers, within a budget of $983,221.
- Highest Absenteeism: 3 individuals had the highest absenteeism rates.
- Weekly Absenteeism: Across all 5 days of the week, the sum of absenteeism time in hours ranged from 553 to 1489.
- Percentage Contribution: The 3 individuals accounted for 14.93% of the total absenteeism time in hours.
- Monthly and Weekly Analysis: Analyzed absenteeism by month and by day of the week.
- Reasons for Absenteeism: Identified reasons for taking leave.



### Recommendations
---
- Focus on high absenteeism individuals with personalized wellness programs.
- Adjust wage increases based on performance and health metrics.
- Investigate and address the causes of high absenteeism on specific days and months.
- Consider flexible scheduling or remote work options to reduce absenteeism.
